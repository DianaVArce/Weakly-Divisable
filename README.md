### by Diana Arce-Hernandez, Ryan McAlpine, and Rommel Ravanera

---------------------------------------------------------------

### About
This program takes as input an integer 'k' between 1 and 200 and returns the number
of strings of length 'k' that are weakly divisible by 7.

### Instructions
Running this file will display a prompt:
“Enter an integer between 1 and 200: “

The results will be printed on the following line, unless provided a number such as 0
or 201 which will tell us there is an invalid input.

### Known Issues
There are no known issues.
